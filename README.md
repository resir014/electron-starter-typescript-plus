# electron-starter-typescript-plus

> An example of James Long's electron-with-server example, modified to work with Webpack + Electron Forge.

This is a version of James Long's amazing [electron-with-server](https://github.com/jlongster/electron-with-server-example) translated to a Webpack-friendly setup with [electron-forge](https://electronforge.io/). See [this blog post](https://jlongster.com/secret-of-good-electron-apps) by James himself to discover the benefits of this architecture.

## Getting started

A Node.js 10.0.0+ setup with yarn is recommended.

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn

# ...or if you'd like to use npm instead
npm install

# run application locally with server window
yarn start

# build for production
yarn make
```
